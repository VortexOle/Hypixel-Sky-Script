# Hypixel-Sky-Script
This is just a Project where I try to programm a Macro/Script to automaticly Farm for Minecraft/Hypixel Skyblock to try and test my coding knowledge.
PS: Alot of the base code is from other mods because im to lazy to code it myself 
#### !!!This is just for educational purposes only and I do not condone cheating in any way. Using the script may result in a ban on Hypixel for abusing a unfair advantage!!!
### Use at your own risk!

## Installation
Download the files as a zip, extract the files and compile it in Eclipse/IntelliJ. Then just double click the .jar file and it (should) automaticly add the mod to the mods folder
